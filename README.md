# Forward-Forward-Algorithm-JAX
Implementation of the paper "The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations" by Geoffrey Hinton using JAX

This repository includes the code for training and testing a simple linear model using the forward-forward technique on the MNIST dataset using JAX.
The implementation also uses hard-negative mining over muti-episode training. The final model achieves 1.8% test accuracy error
compared to the 1.36% reported in the original paper.
